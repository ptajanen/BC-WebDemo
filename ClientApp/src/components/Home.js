  <h1>Pia's 1st Web-app</h1>

  <p>As the title says this is my first attempt to create a web-application,
     6 weeks ago I was a total novise in web-development!
           <strong>This is a Challenge with a capital "C"</strong> as at the moment I've had 25 hours of training
   in Application Development in total! In this 25 hours our brilliant lecturer
   Jani J. has had to introduce us to a huge amount of different techniques and concepts ->
           my head is spinning!</p>

  <p>That is probably why I am now doing what I know, writing this story, instead of
  trying to read about e.g. React that we are using in this project?!
  Now I also realize that this story should probably be written in a separate
  text-file and not here in the code it self, and then my magnificent code would be
           calling it! I will try that later!</p>

  <p>I will try to combine in this demo as many different features that I possibly can.
           <strong>I wish to understand each of them myself</strong> so in the end they might not
   be that many?!
   I will use the structure and elements that were already setup in this project,
   try to modify/enhance them according to my taste/needs. I wish to style the UI,
   render some data from the database, ask for your input and do something with it and
           add some images and links on the page, we'll see how it goes!</p>
  <p>I thank you for having taken the time to read this piece and check-out what I managed
  to come-up with! Cheers, Thank you, Kiitos!
           Pia </p>
  <p>P.S. Did you notice that I already started: I added some <strong>bold</strong> font
           in my text, <strong>YaHoooo!!!</strong></p>
